# AI Response Evaluation and Feedback System - Project Setup

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Verify copilot-instructions.md file created
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements - Python project for LLM evaluation system
- [x] Scaffold the Project - All folders and modules created
- [x] Customize the Project - Evaluation logic implemented
- [x] Install Required Extensions - Python extension (already available)
- [x] Compile the Project - All dependencies installed and tested
- [x] Create and Run Task - Not needed for this project
- [x] Launch the Project - Streamlit dashboard ready
- [x] Create Example Notebooks - All 4 notebooks completed (01-04)
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete - README, docs, and notebooks all complete

## ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE!

## Project Type
Python data science project with Streamlit dashboard

## Project Structure Created
✅ Core modules: data_collection, rubrics, annotation, analysis, visualization
✅ Configuration system
✅ Sample datasets
✅ Streamlit dashboard
✅ Documentation (README.md, rubrics.md)
✅ Example files (.env.example, .gitignore)
✅ Main entry point (main.py)

## Key Components
- Dataset preparation and collection (Alpaca, OpenAI API, custom)
- Rubrics-based evaluation system (Accuracy, Helpfulness, Tone)
- Annotation workflow with simulated scoring
- Statistical analysis (Cohen's Kappa, agreement metrics)
- Visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard with 6 pages

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run data collection or use sample data
3. Annotate responses
4. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard.py`
